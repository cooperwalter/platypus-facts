# Web Pages

The application serves two public-facing web pages via Bun's built-in HTTP server.

## Signup Page (`GET /`)

The landing page where visitors subscribe to Daily Platypus Facts.

### Content

- Project title: "Daily Platypus Facts"
- Tagline about daily platypus facts delivered to your inbox
- Current Platypus Fan count and limit displayed (e.g., "42 / 200 Platypus Fans") with a warm note explaining the limit (e.g., "Since each fact is sent with love (and a small email cost), we can only support 200 Platypus Fans right now.")
- An email input field (required)
- A submit button
- Brief explanation of what the user is signing up for (one platypus fact per day via email)
- When the Platypus Fan cap is reached, the signup form is replaced with a message indicating the service is at capacity (e.g., "We're currently at capacity! Check back later.")

### Design

Platypus themed with a warm, indie, handcrafted feel:
- Platypus imagery or illustrations
- Personality and charm — this is a fun project. Use the platypus emoji combination (🦫🦆🥚) liberally throughout the page to add character — in the title, tagline, fan count, form labels, success/error messages, and footer.
- **Repeating platypus background pattern** — all pages use a subtle, tiled background using the platypus SVG at `public/platypus-icon.svg`. Applied via CSS `background-image` with `background-repeat: repeat`. Low-opacity so it doesn't compete with page content, creating a soft watermark-style texture across the entire page. The icons should be **generously spaced** — not packed tightly together. Use `background-size` and/or padding within the tile to ensure visible gaps between each icon so the pattern feels airy and light, not dense or wallpaper-like.
- **No animated platypus** — there should be no animated, moving, or swimming platypus element on any page. The background pattern is the only platypus decoration.
- **Desktop top padding** — on desktop viewports, the main content area should have generous top padding so it doesn't start right at the top of the page. This gives the design breathing room and lets the background pattern show above the content.

### Behavior

- `POST /api/subscribe` with email address
- On success: display a confirmation message telling the user to check their email
- On validation error: display inline error (invalid email format)
- On rate limit: display a friendly "try again later" message

## Fact Page (`GET /facts/:id`)

Displays a single platypus fact with its sources. Linked from the daily email.

### Content

- The AI-generated platypus illustration for this fact, displayed prominently above the fact text (see `fact-images.md` for style details).
- The fact text prominently displayed
- A list of sources with clickable links (and titles if available)
- "Daily Platypus Facts" branding
- Optional: a link to the signup page for visitors who aren't yet subscribed

### No Image

If a fact does not have a generated image (`image_path` is NULL), the page renders without the image section entirely — no broken image, no placeholder, no empty space. The fact text simply appears at the top. The page layout should look intentional and complete whether or not an image is present.

### Design

Consistent with the signup page theme. Clean, focused on the fact content (and illustration when available). When an image is present, it should be centered and sized appropriately (max-width constrained, responsive).

## Confirmation Page (`GET /confirm/:token`)

Handles email-based subscription confirmation.

- Valid pending token: confirms the subscription, displays a success page.
- Already active: displays "You're already confirmed!" page.
- Invalid/unsubscribed token: displays an appropriate message.
- Cap reached: displays a "we're at capacity" page.

See `subscription-flow.md` for full confirmation logic.

## Unsubscribe Pages (`GET /unsubscribe/:token`, `POST /unsubscribe/:token`)

Handles email-based unsubscribe.

- `GET`: Displays a confirmation page: "Are you sure you want to unsubscribe from Daily Platypus Facts?"
- `POST`: Processes the unsubscribe, displays a success page.
- Invalid token: displays an appropriate message.

## Footer

All public pages include a shared footer with:

- **Inspiration** link — links to an `/inspiration` page (or section) explaining the *Life is Strange: Double Exposure* origin of the project
- **About** link — links to an `/about` page (or section) with information about the project
- **"Made with ❤️ by Cooper Walter"** — displayed prominently in the footer

## Dev Message Viewer (Development Only)

When running with dev providers (see `email-integration.md`), dev-only routes are available for viewing sent emails:

- `GET /dev/messages` — Lists all sent emails (newest first) with recipient, subject/preview, and timestamp.
- `GET /dev/messages/:id` — Displays a specific email, rendering the HTML content.

These routes are only registered when dev providers are active. They are never available in production.

## API Endpoints

### `POST /api/subscribe`

- **Body**: `{ "email": string }`
- **Response**: `{ "success": true, "message": string }` or `{ "success": false, "error": string }`
- **Rate limit**: 5 requests per IP per hour

### `GET /health`

- **Response**: 200 OK when the server is ready (used by Kamal for deploy health checks)

## Static Assets

Serve static assets (CSS, images) from a `public/` directory. This includes AI-generated fact illustrations stored in `public/images/facts/` (see `fact-images.md`).
